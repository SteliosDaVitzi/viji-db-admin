# Contributing to DBsaur

Bug reports, documentation improvements, and focused pull requests are welcome.
For substantial changes, open an issue describing the problem and proposed behavior first.
Report vulnerabilities privately as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development

Use Node.js 24 LTS (24.11+) and Rust 1.95+ with rustfmt and Clippy. From the repository root:

```sh
npm --prefix frontend ci
npm run dev
```

The sample workspace needs no database. See [README.md](README.md) for Docker,
connection storage, and disposable database test configuration.

Before submitting a pull request, run:

```sh
npm run format
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
cargo install cargo-audit --locked
npm run audit
```

Commit both dependency lockfiles when changing dependencies. Do not suppress
advisories or describe an incomplete scan as clean. Never run ignored database
tests unless you explicitly configured a disposable database; some tests create
and drop databases. CI runs the sample and unit tests without database credentials.

## Architecture and review expectations

- Use Nuxt 4 `app/`, Composition API, and strict TypeScript for the frontend.
- Keep Rust HTTP handlers dependent on domain/application contracts; adapters
  implement those contracts. Register providers in the composition root.
- Extend `DatabaseAdapter` and a dedicated provider directory for new databases.
  Describe provider-specific limitations and add relevant boundary tests.
- Keep browsing separate from explicit writes. Bind SQL values, quote dynamic
  identifiers, preserve exact numeric values, sanitize driver errors, and use
  bounded operations. Database permissions remain the security boundary.
- Never log credentials, persist them in browser storage, or include real records,
  connection URLs, vault files, certificates, or private keys in issues or fixtures.
- Keep changes focused. Explain the user-visible behavior, validation performed,
  and limitations. Add tests for behavior changes and security boundaries.
